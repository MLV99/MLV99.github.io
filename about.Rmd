---

I am a graduate Ph.D student in Environmental Engineering Sciences from the University of Florida. My academic background includes a bachelors degree in Biology with a Marine Sciences masters degree from the University of Puerto Rico - Mayag√ºez Campus.  

Future research goals funded by NIH will be focused on exploring pathogenic impacts of Vibrio spp.  in coastal  ecological services and human health. Furthermore, I am developing a literature review concerning per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and their impacts in aquatic systems, which includes trophic interactions, microbial composition changes and interactions with microplastics. 

Subsequently, merging the engineering field with marine sciences to contribute knowledge and management enhancement strategies in our dynamic environment that is the ocean. 




## Hobbies 

Aside from research, I also enjoy art activities such as acrylic painting, scuba diving, photography, traveling, video games, and  singing.
