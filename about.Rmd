title: "About me"
---

I am a graduate master's student in Marine Sciences from the University of Puerto Rico - Mayagüez Campus. My background is in Biology, as I completed my bachelor's degree at the same institution. 

My current academic goal is to continue my graduate studies in Environmental Engineering with a specialization in Coastal System Dynamics at the University of Florida this Fall 2023. 

Subsequently, merging the engineering field with marine sciences to contribute knowledge and management enhancement strategies in our dynamic environment that is the ocean. 

## Current Thesis Project 

Research project efforts to achieve enhanced yellowtail snapper sampling for sustainable
management implementation in Puerto Rico consist of the following objectives:
• Profiling of fishers and yellowtail snapper species (colirrubia, O. chrysurus).
o Identify when, where, and how the species should be sampled through fisher
interviews and LEK.
• Ultimately, provide adequate data concerning the yellowtail snapper species within the
island for enhanced implementation of sustainable management practices.
